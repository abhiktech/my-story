** MyStory**
A platform to create, reminisce, and share stories. 
Link - http://mystory11.herokuapp.com/

**Motivation**
I was very interested in building a potentially scalable full stack application. Out of the many project ideas that I had filtered out, I decided to build a story sharing web app where users can perform CRUD operations on their stories/posts and can view stories of other users.

**Built With**
- 'Node.js'
- 'Express'
- 'MongoDB'
- 'Passport.js'
- 'Materialize'

**Features**
- Enables Google authentication using 'Passport.js' and 'Google OAuth 2.0 protocol'.
- Allows users to create, edit, delete, and share stories.

**Local Installation**
- 'git pull https://github.com/abhiktech/my-story.git'
- Install dependencies by looking at package.json 
- *Note* : I had nodemon as a global dependency so you might want to install that too
- Run the server using 'npm run dev'
