# MyStory
A platform to create, reminisce, and share stories.<br />
**Link** - **http://mystory11.herokuapp.com/**

## Motivation
I was very interested in building a potentially scalable full stack application. Out of the many project ideas that I had filtered out, I decided to build a story sharing web app where users can perform CRUD operations on their stories/posts and can view stories of other users.

## Built With
- `Node.js`
- `Express`
- `MongoDB`
- `Passport.js`
- `Materialize`

## Features
- Enables Google authentication using `Passport.js` and `Google OAuth 2.0 protocol`.
- Allows users to perform CRUD operations on their stories.
- Grants users to view the public stories of other users.

## Local Installation
- `git pull https://github.com/abhiktech/my-story.git`
- Install dependencies by looking at `package.json` 
- *Note* : I had `nodemon` as a global dependency and I would recommend you to install it too
- Run the server using `npm run dev`
